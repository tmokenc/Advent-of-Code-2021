# Advent-of-Code-2021
My solution for the advent of code 2021, written in Rust

## Error Handle
**NOPE!!!** `unwrap()` everything everywhere

## Use
To run all of the advent of code solutions
```sh
cargo run --release
```
To run only a specific day (replace {DAY_NUMBER} with the number of that day)
```sh
cargo run --release -- {DAY_NUMBER}
```

## Performance

These timing was done on my shitty $5 VPS

#### Note
- **Day 15 part 2**: ~~yep, [1 hour and 20 minutes](https://imgur.com/a/yAlGIHN)~~ Well, its execution time is now under 200 milliseconds...
- **Day 17 part 2**: Brute forced it, computer's problems require programming solutions
- **Day 19**: I calculate the beacons and scanners location while parsing the input since it does not require the full input to be done, that's why the execution time are fast but the parsing is not

## Dependencies
- **humantime** - to display the running time
- **owo-colors** - to print colored result in terminal
